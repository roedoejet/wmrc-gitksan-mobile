    <p class="whiteText">Hello! Welcome to the demonstration version of the Online <b>Gitksan</b> Dictionary with 5000 new audio files added in July 2019. The
      dictionary is
      an initiative of the <a href="http://lingserver.arts.ubc.ca/linguistics/research/Gitxsan_group">Gitksan Research
        Lab</a></p>
    <p class="whiteText">Please feel free to use this dictionary for educational purposes only.</p>
    <p class="whiteText">Please be aware that this should <em>not</em> be considered a working version of the
      dictionary. Search
      functionality is being updated and algorithms are being worked on to ensure better searching capabilities,
      but in the interim, full search functionality for the dictionary should not be expected. More information
      about this dictionary will be posted to this site soon.</p>
    <p class="whiteText">We would like to thank the generous time of all of the people involved in the dictionary, and
      we hope
      to update this site soon with more information about everybody involved.</p>
    <p class="whiteText">We would also like to thank artist Maaslik’i’nsxw (Ken Mowatt)'s generous donation of artwork
      to this project.</p>
    <p class="whiteText">This project was supported by the SSHRC Insight Grant 435-2016-1694, 'Enhancing Lexical
      Resources for
      BC First Nations Languages'.</p>
